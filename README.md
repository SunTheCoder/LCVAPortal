### Loading Strategy
```swift
// Unified PreloadManager
class PreloadManager: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = PreloadManager()
    
    func preloadAllContent() async {
        // 1. Load artifacts
        // 2. Load exhibitions
        // 3. Preload images
    }
}

// Elegant Splash Screen
struct SplashView: View {
    @ObservedObject var preloadManager = PreloadManager.shared
    
    // Beautiful animations while loading
    // Waits for preloading completion
    // Smooth transition to main content
}
```

This architecture ensures:
- Professional first impression
- No visible loading screens
- Data ready when needed
- Efficient resource usage
- Polished user experience

## Dependencies
- Firebase
- FirebaseFirestore
- SwiftUI
- Custom Supabase Client with RPC support

## Features

- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Supabase Integration
  - Artifact Storage
  - User Collections
  - User Profiles
    - Avatar URLs stored in Supabase users table
  - Reflections & Media Storage
- Real-time Chat
- Media Upload Support
  - Images
  - Videos
  - Text Reflections

## Database Structure

### Supabase Tables
- `users`
  - `id` (from Firebase Auth)
  - `email`
  - `name`
  - `created_at`
  - `avatar_url` - User's profile image URL
- `artifacts`
- `collections`
- `user_collections`
- `artifact_reflections`
- `chat_messages`

### Firebase Collections
- `users` (legacy, migrating to Supabase)
- `chats`

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Firebase configuration

## Migration Notes

The app is gradually migrating user data from Firebase to Supabase:
- User profiles and avatars now stored in Supabase
- Chat messages remain in Firebase
- Media storage handled by Supabase Storage

## Database Functions

### Supabase RPC Functions
#### Implementation Strategy
The app uses a three-tier approach for efficient data management:

1. **ArtifactManager** - Singleton state container
```swift
@MainActor
class ArtifactManager: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = ArtifactManager()
    @Published var artifacts: [Artifact] = []
    
    func preloadArtifacts() async {
        // Preload artifacts at app launch
    }
}
```

2. **App-Level Preloading** - Data ready before user needs it
```swift
@main
struct LCVAPortalApp: App {
    @StateObject private var artifactManager = ArtifactManager.shared
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .task {
                    await artifactManager.preloadArtifacts()
                }
                .environmentObject(artifactManager)
        }
    }
}
```

3. **View-Level Consumption** - Clean, efficient data access
```swift
struct CollectionsView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var artifactManager: ArtifactManager
    
    var displayedArtPieces: [ArtPiece] {
        artifactManager.artifacts
            .filter { $0.on_display }
            .map(convertToArtPiece)
    }
}
```

This architecture ensures:
- Data is loaded once at app launch
- No redundant network calls
- Consistent state across views
- Efficient memory usage

#### Available Functions
- `get_all_artifacts()`: Retrieves complete artifact collection
- `get_artifacts_by_collection(collection_name TEXT)`: Filters artifacts by collection
- `get_exhibition_data()`: Retrieves all exhibitions

Example usage in Swift:
```swift
// Fetch all artifacts
let artifacts = try await artifactService.fetchAllArtifacts()

// Fetch collection-specific artifacts
let collectionArtifacts = try await artifactService.fetchArtifactsByCollection(
    collectionName: "African Art"
)
```

## Caching Architecture

### Image Caching Implementation
```swift
class ImageCache {
    static let shared = ImageCache()
    private let cacheDirectory: URL
    
    func saveImageToDisk(image: UIImage, filename: String)
    func loadImageFromDisk(filename: String) -> UIImage?
    func imageExists(filename: String) -> Bool
}
```

### Video Caching Implementation
```swift
class VideoCache {
    static let shared = VideoCache()
    private let cacheDirectory: URL
    private var memoryCache: [String: AVPlayer] = [:]
    private var activeDownloads: [String: Task<Void, Error>] = [:]
    
    func cacheVideo(from url: URL, filename: String) async throws
    func getCachedVideo(urlString: String, filename: String) -> AVPlayer?
    func clearCache()
}
```

### Specialized Media Views
```swift
// Main collection grid images
struct CachedCollectionImageView: View {
    let urlString: String
    let filename: String
    // Optimized for grid display
}

// Thumbnail list images
struct CachedCollectionThumbView: View {
    let urlString: String
    let filename: String
    let size: CGFloat
    // Optimized for list views
}

// Video player with caching
struct CachedVideoPlayer: View {
    let urlString: String
    let filename: String
    // Handles loading, caching, and playback
}
```

### Benefits
- Instant loading of previously viewed media
- Reduced server load and bandwidth usage
- Offline functionality for cached content
- Optimized memory usage
- Context-specific media handling
- Concurrent download management
- Automatic resource cleanup
