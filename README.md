## Database Structure

### Supabase Tables
- `users`
  - `id` (from Firebase Auth)
  - `email`
  - `name`
  - `created_at`
  - `avatar_url` - User's profile image URL
- `artifacts`
- `collections`
- `user_collections`
- `artifact_reflections`
- `chat_messages`

### Firebase Collections
- `users` (legacy, migrating to Supabase)
- `chats`

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Firebase configuration

## Migration Notes

The app is gradually migrating user data from Firebase to Supabase:
- User profiles and avatars now stored in Supabase
- Chat messages remain in Firebase
- Media storage handled by Supabase Storage

## Database Functions

### Supabase RPC Functions
- `get_all_artifacts()`: Retrieves complete artifact collection
- `get_artifacts_by_collection(collection_name TEXT)`: Filters artifacts by collection

These functions are implemented with:
- Security invoker permissions
- Proper anon role access
- Optimized query performance
- Type-safe returns

Example usage in Swift:
```swift
// Fetch all artifacts
let artifacts = try await artifactService.fetchAllArtifacts()

// Fetch collection-specific artifacts
let collectionArtifacts = try await artifactService.fetchArtifactsByCollection(
    collectionName: "African Art"
)
```
